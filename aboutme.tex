\tinysection{About me}
As an innovative and adaptable full-stack developer, I am passionate about exploring new technologies. I enjoy creating new functions and UI to offer the user a great experience. And involved in solving the problems. I have quickly mastered React and Go, improving myself from front-end to full-stack development. My diverse sales, marketing, and restaurant management background has equipped me with a unique blend of technical expertise and strong interpersonal skills. These experiences have fostered in me a results-oriented approach and a commitment to efficient execution. I'm passionate about software engineering principles and am actively developing my expertise in software architecture and DevOps practices to become a software architect.
